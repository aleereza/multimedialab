1,Multimedia ergonomics,Short introduction for research 1,The word ergonomics probably makes you think about comfortable chairs or pillows. But physical objects are not the only things we interact with. You likely spend a good portion of each day looking at images or video, listening to music, or browsing websites. Are these digital objects comfortable? We want to understand how people interact with digital objects, especially multimedia signals, in order to facilitate better user experience and more seamless interaction with our digital environment.
2,Compressed vision,Short introduction for research 2,Remember the movie The Matrix, where software agents and trained human operators are able to spot objects and people from endless streams of digital data? Is this really possible? For humans, unlikely. But we have suceeded in training machines to do something like that. Being able to analyze compressed streams, without decoding, is one of the key technologies needed to handle massive amounts of video in the era of Big Data.
3,Point clouds,Short introduction for research 3,Point clouds are sets of points in 3D space that describe the surface or shape of an object, and may carry additional attributes such as color. They were used for some time in computer graphics and animation industry, then 3D printing, and are now making their way towards mainstream through virtual/augmented reality and immersive media. Their irregular sampling makes their processing more challenging.
4,Sound fields,Short introduction for research 4,Sound fields are acoustic counterparts of 3D video. They are essential for a covincing sense of immersion in virtual and augmented reality. Our work in this area is on spatial sound field control in noisy environments, array element placement, array signal processing, as well as study and design of loudspeaker and microphone array patterns.
5,Computational sustainability,Short introduction for research 5,Computational sustainability tries to balance the needs of the environment, the economy, and society to solve sustainability problems using computational tools, models and algorithms. We are particularly interested in solving climate change and energy challenges through the theme of conservation and habitual change. To this end, we work with both academic and industry partners to develop and commercialize our discoveries and solutions.

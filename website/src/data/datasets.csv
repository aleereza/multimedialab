1,FDDB-360,"This dataset includes a collection of images from theÂ Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark (FDDB) that haven been processed to look like fisheye images coming from a typical 360-degree camera. The dataset allows one to train face detectors on fisheye-looking images. The dataset includes images, face annotations, sample code to train and test a face detector, as well as a sample face detection model described in the paper below.",http://dx.doi.org/10.25314/d61c9cad-7a7f-4c77-89c7-2bc664bed00f
2,Eye tracking dataset for standard video sequences,"This dataset includes a database of gaze locations by 15 independent viewers on a set of 12 standard CIF video sequences: Foreman, Bus, City, Crew, Flower Garden, Mother and Daughter, Soccer, Stefan, Mobile Calendar, Harbor, and Tempete. Included are the gaze locations for the first and second viewing of each sequence, their visualizations, heat maps, and sample MATLAB demo files that show how to use the data.",http://www.sfu.ca/~ibajic/datasets/SFU_etdb.rar
3,Segmented foreground objects,"This dataset includes manually segmented foreground objects that we used as the ground truth in our moving region segmentation. Each set contains segmentation masks, segmented object(s), and original frames.",http://www.sfu.ca/~ibajic/datasets/foreground_seg.zip
